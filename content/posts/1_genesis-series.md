My Genesis series has finally been unleashed.

It took me about 3 months of hard work to come up with 9 original Genesis NFTs which mark the beggining of my first steps in the digital art and NFT space.

I draw inspiration from surrealist artists like the polish painter Zdzislaw Beksinski.

Some of my earlier works in real world materials already kind of materialized this tendency and fascination with the weird and surreal landscape of the unconscious mind and perception.
